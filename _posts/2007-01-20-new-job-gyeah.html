It's been a long time coming.  I've decided to change jobs.  This is my first job change out of college.  I've been at that company for 5.5 years.  Thats quite some time.  I start at the new place on January 29th. 

My new company is CCC Information Services located within the Merchandise Mart.  I'm still downtown which is very nice but now I have a longer walk to get to the office from the train station.  Maybe that walk will motivate me to start working out more.

At my last job, I led a team of programmers and analysts that performed conversions from 3rd party systems onto the proprietary application.  I did a lot of work on a Mainframe using SAS, for the most part.  Also, I did do some scripting in the windows shell and using Ruby(very nice! (c) borat), but by and large SAS was the language of choice at my last job.  Note that SAS was not the language of my choice.  It kinda feels weird saying "last job". 

At CCC, I expect to be in a lead role as well, but I'll be doing a number of tasks.  More of my time will be spent doing Business Intelligence type work, but I will also get to do some of the prototype work in Rails.  So right now I'm leading a pilot project to develop a new internal app for the PMO that will go on the intranet. 

All in all, I'm very pleased with making this new job change and I'm confident it will lead to bigger and better things.
