<div><a href="http://startonomics.com/">Startonomics</a> was setup by <a href="http://dealmakermedia.com/">Dealmaker Media</a> and took place on the wonderful campus of UCLA at the <a href="http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/">Anderson School of Management</a>.  As the website says, the purpose of the conference was to help entrepreneurs create strategies and actionable metrics to help them build better products and make better decisions.  I personally was very keen on this event because I have a passion for measuring and managing performance and innovation through metrics.  </div><div>
</div>I recommend that you check out the <a href="http://startonomics.com/blog">Startonomics blog</a> for details on the conference as well as all of the video.  I learned quite a bit and met many interesting people who were at various stages within their ventures.  Yet if you want to get the quick gist of the conference, I bring you my top 10 themes of Startonomics:<div><ol><li>Web 1.0 was about things, and Web 2.0 is about people.  As a result, your value as a startup is proportional to the number of users / viewers of your site.  </li><li>If you've got partners in your venture, please, draw up a legal agreement that spells out how equity will be split up.  Very important if a partner decides to leave the start-up.  </li><li>Fail Fast!  Admit your failures and move on. 
</li><li>Decisions made in the first 90 days of your venture will have lasting effects. 
</li><li>The most important part of your start-up is passion.</li><li>What is your ultimate objective?  Is it to make money?  Get more users?  Pick one and work toward it!</li><li>Create a blog and create compelling content.  Make sure the design is clean and you cross link all of your content. 
</li><li>When hiring or getting money for your venture, can you see yourself hanging out with this person at a bar?
</li><li>Hire good athletes - quick learners over those with deep experience.
</li><li>Trends are more important than milestones.
</li></ol>Spending my career figuring out the best ways to track project / company performance, the last point really hits home.  Sometimes managers and even some entrepreneurs get hung up on the idea that progress and processes need to be tracked within the business and tracked to great detail.  That's simply not the case.  As one of my mentors stated to me, it's more important to be directionally correct versus precisely inaccurate.
