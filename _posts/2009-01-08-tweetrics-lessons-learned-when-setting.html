I recently put together <a href="http://tweetrics.info/">tweetrics</a>.  It's a site dedicated to tracking public twitter accounts, graphing daily and cumulative activity.  I had a lot of fun putting the site together, unfortunately it wasn't without its problems.  Before I get into that, lets get into how the site is setup.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Backend Setup

</span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7qcbQ5ZcM54/SWbGeR2d_fI/AAAAAAAABi8/n59oF0kv_Uo/s1600-h/tweetrics_setup.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7qcbQ5ZcM54/SWbGeR2d_fI/AAAAAAAABi8/n59oF0kv_Uo/s400/tweetrics_setup.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289133035883462130" border="0" /></a>For the backend setup, I used <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> and <a href="http://www.merbivore.com/">Merb</a>.  I know Merb is going to merge with Rails, but I found building tweetrics as an opportunity to get more familiar with the nuancies of Merb.  I wanted to use the run_later method in merb to offload the processing of tweets because it's a very processor intensive task, but I decided against it.  The main reason being run_later creates a queue per merb process on the server and not a global queue.  The global queue was important to me because I did not want multiple instances of the method that builds the twitter activity because my server does not have very much memory.  Also, from what I've read on the web, I couldn't use run_later even if I wanted to because it does work behind Passenger.

Instead of run_later, I used beanstalk.  I found instructions that met my needs at <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/about-this-blog-beanstalk-messaging-queue">Nuby on Rails</a>.  The instructions were pretty clear and the setup of the software to get beanstalk up and running was pretty painless.  Like the Nuby on Rails article, I also had a database that recorded the state of jobs in the queue should the beanstalk instance crash.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Frontend Setup</span>

To get the front end working, I used a combination of JQuery, the Google Visualization API and a little bit of Ajax.  Working with the Google Visualization API was a complete breeze.  All you need is a couple of lines of javascript in your page and POW!  The visualization shows up.  I was even suprised the charts could be rendered after issuing some JQuery UI effects.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't Make These Mistakes</span>

After writing this app, I learned a few things.  Hopefully by posting this, you won't have the same problems that I did.
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When using Beanstalk and the Ruby gem beanstalk-client, make sure that you use the yput method and not put.</span><p>yput will serialize the object before putting it into the message queue and then your worker can pull it out and deserialize it.  I tried to get around the serialization step by using the put method but for me, I kept getting errors and the job would not get inserted into the queue.  I struggled with this for a while before giving up and using yput.</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When using Google Visualization API, make sure the user's url and the hostname in Json Requests actually match.</span><p>This was quite frankly a stupid mistake on my part.  The charts page actually pulls in a static JSON file that has the chart data unfortunately the hostname of the url to request the JSON file was hardcoded as http://tweetrics.info/.  If a user accessed the site using http://www.tweetrics.info/ instead, the Google Visualization would not pull the data into the charts.</p></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you're using the Google Visualization API, load JQuery from Google instead of hosting it on your own site.  </span><p>Pulling JQuery from Google can save you oodles of bandwidth.  Just do it like so.....<pre name="code" class="javascript"><script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script></pre></p>
</li></ol>
