Theres a lot of info out on web concerning how to get the D-Link DWL-520 E1 working in ubuntu.  Unfortunately I could not find one complete source for all of the information to properly get this wireless card working.  The <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/DWL-520vE1">wiki article</a> on the Ubuntu site is fairly complete, but it was just missing a few critical details.  I'll attempt to walk you through the process I followed of finding the actual error on the system, finding the firmware and finally updating the startup scripts.

My box is a fairly generic setup that doesn't have any cutting edge hardware installed.  I proceeded to install ubuntu v6.10 onto this machine with all the relative ease that is ubuntu.  Once installed, everything worked except for the wireless lan card, the afore mentioned DWL-520.  So.. I started by looking up a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported?highlight=%28wireless%29%7C%28card%29">breakdown of the wireless cards</a> that would work upon installation.  Just my luck, the DWL-520 doesn't work upon installation, but on this doc, I found the link to the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/DWL-520vE1">wiki article</a> that explained what needed to be done to install it.  I then followed the directions starting with the "Prepare the Firmware" section and proceeded to reboot upon completion.  Upon the restart, the card still didn't work.  Crap.

Now it was time for a little investigation.  I did a quick ifconfig at the command line and found that the device wasn't showing up at all.  I also found that the device was showing up when examining the devices on the pci bus.  So, I did some digging on the web and found that this particular card requires the firmware to be loaded to memory.  Unfortunately, the wiki article only goes as far as setting up the /etc/network/interfaces file, but you really need to take it to the next step to actually actively load the firmware.  

Heres a break down of the extra steps that are needed to get the DWL-520 to work.  This assumes that you followed the directions from the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/DWL-520vE1">wiki article</a>.

1. Make sure you have orinoco_pci, hermes, and orinoco all blacklisted in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist 
<code>
# causes the dlink dwl-520vE1 card not to be recognized properly
# at boottime
blacklist orinoco_pci
blacklist orinoco
blacklist hermes
</code>

2. Install hostap-utils.
<code>
apt-get install hostap-utils
</code>or
<code>
wget http://hostap.epitest.fi/releases/hostap-utils-0.4.7.tar.gz
</code>
I actually would recommend the not using apt-get because there is a script that comes with the utils package that makes the setup much easier.  Although, if you download the package you have to compile it and install.  

3. Move the hostap_fw_load script to /usr/local/sbin, and properly configure for your system.  
<code>
#!/bin/sh

# Example script for automatically loading firmware images when needed. This
# can be run, e.g., from /etc/pcmcia/wireless.

# Firmware images for the card
# TODO: could try to select correct firmware type automatically

PRI=/etc/firmware/pm010102.hex
STA=/etc/firmware/rf010804.hex
PRISM2_SREC=/usr/sbin/prism2_srec

set -e

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 <ifname>"
    exit 1
fi

IFNAME=$1
DIR=/proc/net/hostap/$IFNAME

if [ ! -d $DIR ]; then
    echo "Host AP driver data for device $IFNAME not found in procfs."
    exit 1
fi

if grep -q no_pri=1 $DIR/debug; then
    # no primary image - load primary in two steps, first without PDA and then
    # with full PDA plugging
    echo "Downloading primary firmware $PRI"
    $PRISM2_SREC -gs $IFNAME $PRI
    $PRISM2_SREC -gp $IFNAME $PRI
fi

if grep -q pri_only=1 $DIR/debug; then
    echo "Downloading secondary (station) firmware $STA"
    $PRISM2_SREC -rp $IFNAME $STA
fi

echo "Card is ready with both PRI and STA firmware images"
</code>
Please note the top options, PRI, STA, and PRISM2_SREC.  This is the complete script, so if you originally did an apt-get of the hostap-utils, you can copy this and make it an executable file.  

4. Tweak the /etc/network/interface file
Add this line to the wlan0 configuration:
<code>
pre-up /usr/local/sbin/hostap_fw_load wlan0
</code>
It should look something like this now:
<code>
auto wlan0

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
pre-up /usr/local/sbin/hostap_fw_load wlan0
wireless_nick DWL-520
fw_primary /etc/firmware/pm010102.hex
fw_secondary /etc/firmware/rf010804.hex
wireless_mode managed
</code>

5. Restart your networking 
<code>
/etc/init.d/networking restart
</code>

Now your card should be working and ready to go.  You can now go to System -> Administration -> Networking to setup your credentials to attach to a wireless network.
