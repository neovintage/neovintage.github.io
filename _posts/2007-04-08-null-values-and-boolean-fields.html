When creating a new object in Rails and you want the value to result in a NULL value in the database, you typically just have to set the value of the field to nil and you're on your way.  In my situation, I needed to default the value of the Boolean field on the table to NULL if the user did not select a value.  I used a collection select method to allow the user to select "Yes", "No" or to leave the field blank.  Then in the controller I thought that I could just refer to the params[:new_object] and I would be good.  Unfortunately, when creating the new object the value of the field was always getting set to false.  Lets go over how I initially setup my code.  

In the form:
<code><% form_tag(save_review_reviews_path(@project, @phase), :method => :put, :id => params[:phase_id]) do %>
  <% @review_points.each_with_index do |rp, index| %>
    <% fields_for "rp[#{index}]", rp do |f| %>
      <%= f.collection_select(:compliant, [{"1" => "Yes"}, {"0" => "No"}], :keys, :values, :include_blank => true) -%>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %></code>
In the controller code:
<code>params[:rp].each_value do |rp|
  @review.review_points.build(:compliant => rp[:compliant])
end</code>
Every time I ran through the tests the value was always getting set to false when the user had left the select box blank.  I tried removing the :include_blank in the collection select and putting another hash for nil, {nil => ""}.  That didn't work either, the value was still getting set to false.  In try number two, I used the code as posted above, and then I tried to default the value of record to NULL through the migration.  That failed as well.  

Finally, I just decided to add an extra step before actually building the record in the controller.  As a result, the action worked as I expected, I was able to insert NULL values.  This is how the controller looks now:
<code>params[:rp].each_value do |rp|
  rp[:compliant] = nil if rp[:compliant] == ""
  @review.review_points.build(:compliant => rp[:compliant])
end</code>
Too bad we could just use the params object and automatically default the field to null when creating the object.
