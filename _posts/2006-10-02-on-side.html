I've been wanting to post something over the last couple of days.  Just about anything really.  I've been working on that SAS testing framework for the mainframe for the last couple of weeks in the office, but really I wanted to talk about whats been going on, on the side.

Recently myia has been taking sewing classes.  Really, really cool.  Maybe she'll get to making me clothes... ;)  I have yet to see any of the stuff that shes actually sewn for her first class but I have seen a lot of the materials from the second, pattern design.  The pattern design class definately seemed like a lot of work but I'm sure by the end of the semester she'll be able to design clothing.  I doubt she'll be the next ralph lauren after this semester, but if she gives it some time, I'm sure she'll be able to make some pretty rad things.

As for me, I've been busy doing things around the house and for my little side project.  I got this wyld idea that I would make my own hard cider.  Where I came up with that idea is still a mystery to me.  So, I ended up purchasing a home brewing kit from <a href="http://www.leeners.com/">leeners</a>, namely one specific for <a href="http://www.leeners.com/hardcider.html">hard cider</a>.  When I originally purchased it, I had no idea what I was doing.  Quite frankly I still don't.  The reading material that came with the equipment was pretty inadiquate.  So I turned to my trusty friend Google to get the answers.  I really didn't find a ton of information out there, but enough to at least get started.  Anyway, the kit only took care of the fermentation process, I still needed a way to get the juice from the apples.  As a result, over the last weekend, I managed to build my own apple press.  It took a little while only because I had other things to do, but I was able to finish. 

Hopefully, in the coming days, I'll be able to post a little more about my cider making process.  Just if you were wondering, I did take pictures the entire time.
