Its been quite a while since I've made a mix.  Its been even longer since I got new music.  Regardless I spend some time today to pick some new tunes out for an hour of listening enjoyment.

Please note that its been a while since I last made a mix and my "skillz" weren't ninja-like in the past, so some of the parts are a little choppy, not to mention my levels were off.

Tracklist:
<ol><li>Aspect - Soul Lady (blu saphir)</li><li>Paul B &amp; Yana Kay - Waiting for your Love (Euphoria)
</li><li>Logistics - Call Me Back (Now More Than Ever EP - Hospital)</li><li>Calibre - Derranged (Derranged EP - Soul:R)</li><li>Sonic - Saigon Traffic (Bingo)</li><li>Seba - Heaven Sent feat Robert Manos (Soul:R)</li><li>Kubicks and Lomax - Edge City (Liquid V)</li><li>Logistics - City Life (Now More Than Ever EP - Hospital)
</li><li>Mathematics and Tactile - Espirit (Social Studies)</li><li>Synopix - Veteran (Fokuz)</li><li>Total Science - Soul Patrol (Sunny Side Up Mix) (CIA)</li><li>Locuss - Foundation (Cymbalism Liquified)</li><li>Junior Cartel - Havana (Renegade Recordings)
</li></ol>Download:
