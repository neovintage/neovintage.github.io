There are two truths to the title of this post.  I did go MIA(Missing in Action) for a number of months and wasn't able to update the blog.  Secondly, the MBA is one of the reasons for my disappearance. 

I made the decision to get my MBA approximately one year ago from this date and at the time I was living in Chicago.  I took my GMATs and submitted all of my paperwork to various programs across the country.  Little did I know that the submission was the easy part.  Upon acceptance to Pepperdine, I was greeted with a lot of information from the school and not much time to get my life in order before I had to move to California.  I will also note that during this time I got engaged and had to plan my wedding!  All of this went down approximately in May of this year and these life altering tasks had to be finished before August 16th, the move date.  Four months sounds like a long time, but trust me, my wife and I barely got through it.  

Anyway....  I'm writing this post to inform everyone that the dust has settled and I'm getting back into blogging.  This blog will still have a focus on Ruby but I'll be intersecting that with the business aspects of technology.  Don't get me wrong, I still love to write code and keep up with the happenings in the Ruby ecosystem.  I've redesigned the blog and I'm looking forward to future posts.
