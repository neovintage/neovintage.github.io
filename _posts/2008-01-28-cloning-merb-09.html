Merb 0.9 is going to be officially announced in a couple of weeks at acts_as_conference but for those looking to get a jump start on the action (myself included), you can pull down the latest version from <a href="http://github.com/wycats">github</a>.

If you don't already have git installed, I recommend following these instructions on Ramanan's blog for those that use Mac OS X: <a href="http://funkaoshi.com/blog/building-git-on-mac-os-x"> Building Git on Mac OS X</a>

The next step is to clone the source from github.  Now its important to note that merb has now been split into two parts, merb-core and merb-more.  I'm only going to follow the instructions for merb-core but the same process applies to merb-more. 
<ol>
 <li>Clone the merb-core source to your local machine<pre name="code" class="ruby">git clone git://github.com/wycats/merb-core.git</pre>This will create a new folder in your current working directory named 'merb-core'</li>
 <li>Build the gem
<pre name="code" class="ruby">cd merb-core/
rake gem</pre></li>
 <li>Install<pre name="code" class="ruby">cd pkg/
gem install merb-core-0.9.0.gem</pre></li>
</ol>And there you have it.  You're ready to start playing around with the new merb-core!  One quick note, make sure you use merb.9 at the command line instead of merb.
