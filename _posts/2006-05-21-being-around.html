I spent most of this weekend contemplating and thinking.  No..... I wasn't alone most of the time.  I actually had things to do and I was relatively busy the entire time. 

I one thought seemed to come up more than a couple of times.  Making plans.  Do some people expect everyone else to make all of the plans?  That question was a little extreme, but I'm referring to something more subtle than that.

The rhtorical question of the day.....    Do you feel like nothing happens unless you explicitly say that youre free?
