<p>Just as a quick note, I had upgraded from Mongoid 2.0 Beta 4 to Mongoid 2.0 Beta 6 when I ran into some weird errors like:<br><tt>ActionView::Template::Error (Database should be a Mongo::DB, not NilClass)</tt><br>and<br><tt>Mongoid::Errors::InvalidDatabase: Mongoid::Errors::InvalidDatabase</tt></p>

<p>Essentially, you can keep your Mongoid code the way it is, but you need to put this line of code at the top of your <tt>config/application.rb</tt>:<pre name="code" class="ruby">require 'mongoid/railtie'</pre>I hope that helps someone out there.</p>
