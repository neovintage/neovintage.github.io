<p>As with anything I do on this blog, it's to make sure that I don't forget what I just learned.  Below are some of the things that I've learned while using Mongoid on my current project, <a href="http://bethebuilders.com/">Be The Builders</a>.  Just to note, I'm working off the current beta version of Mongoid 2.0.0.beta4 and MongoDB 1.4.0.</p>

<p><ul><li><b>Document != Embedded Document</b> - This seem pretty obvious, but it didn't to me at first.  Be The Builders is my first attempt at using a document oriented db, and since I came from a very heavy relational db world (read: business intelligence), this kinda screwed me up.  Once you write <tt>embedded_in</tt> in your model, that model then becomes an embedded document and some things from documents don't apply any more:<ul><li>Mongoid::Versioning</li><li>indexes - Well sorta, you'll see later that you can get around this</li></ul>
<li><b>Don't create indexes on Embedded Docs! (sorta)</b> - When I initially started to create my Mongoid models, I thought I could do something like this:<pre name='code' class='ruby'>
class Post 
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :author
  field :text
  field :publish_date, :type => Date
  embeds_many :comments
  index [:author, :asc]
end

class Comment
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :author
  field :text
  field :publish_date, :type => Date
  embedded_in :post, :inverse_of => :comments
  index [:publish_date, :desc]
end</pre>Unfortunately, I kept getting an InvalidCollection Error from Mongoid and for the life of me couldn't figure it out.  I knew MongoDB allowed its users to <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes#Indexes-EmbeddedKeys">create indexes</a> on an embedded document.  After a little testing, I came up with this instead:<pre name="code" class="ruby">
class Post 
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :author
  field :text
  field :publish_date, :type => Date
  embeds_many :comments
  index [:author, :asc]
  index ["comments.publish_date", :desc]
end

class Comment
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :author
  field :text
  field :publish_date, :type => Date
  embedded_in :post, :inverse_of => :comments
end</pre>Lesson:  If you want to create indexes on embedded documents, create the index in the parent document.  Then use a string to denote what you want indexed.  
</li><li><b>Don't hesitate to drop into the lower level 'mongo' driver</b> - There's a lot that Mongoid already does that's not even listed on its website, like cursors.  Yet, I find that I want to do things like map reduce on a collection.  Fortunately for us, the mongo driver is a requirement for Mongoid.  So when you call <tt>Post.collection</tt> you actually get a collection object from the mongo driver which then we can run <tt>map_reduce</tt>.  Chaining this example together, it would look something like this:<pre name="code" class="ruby">
m = 'function(){ this.tags.forEach( function(z){ emit( z , { count : 1 } ); } ); };'
r = <<-REDUCE
function( key , values ){
  var total = 0;
  for ( var i=0; i < values.length; i++ )
    total += values[i].count;
  return { count : total };
};
REDUCE
Post.collection.map_reduce(m, r)
</pre>There are plenty more functions that can be found in the mongo driver, but if you're looking for map_reduce, you can find it in the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce">main docs</a> and the <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/ruby/1.0.1/Mongo/Collection.html#map_reduce-instance_method">RDoc</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>That's all I've got for now.  When I figure out more you can bet that I will be posting it here.  MongoDB / Mongoid have been a joy to work with.</p>
