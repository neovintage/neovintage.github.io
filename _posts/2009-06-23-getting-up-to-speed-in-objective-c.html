<p>Since playing around with MacRuby, I figured, to keep myself relevant in the programming space I should learn Objective-C / Cocoa.  That and it seems every person that has touched Ruby is now hopping on the Objective-C bandwagon.  EVERYONE WANTS TO BE AN IPHONE DEVELOPER!  Just kidding.</p>

<p><h3>My requirements for learning materials:</h3>
<ul><li>I really didn't want to pay for anything, but I'll have to if I must.</li>
<li>I wanted all my materials to be online or pdf.</li></ul></p>

<p>Basically my requirements cut out things like classes and most screencasts.</p>

<p><h3>This is what I ended up with (its also in order of operation):</h3>
<ul><li><b><a href="https://peepcode.com/products/objective-c-for-rubyists">Peepcode Objective C Screencast:</a></b>  I have purchased a number of his screencasts in the past and have been pleased, so I figured why not get this one, <strong>it was only $9</strong>.  It was a well put together screencast but I felt like something was lacking.  That, or I was being lazy.  Yet I found that I wanted more of an introduction to some of the major frameworks on Mac OS X and the iPhone. Uh oh, there's that word again, 'iPhone'.  I think if you're just looking for an introduction into the semantics of the language, start here.  Otherwise, like me you'll move on to the Stanford Class.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php">CS193P - iPhone Application Programming:</a></b> This class was great, and on top of it, it was free!  Now I wasn't specifically looking for iPhone application development, but the topics covered were still very pertinent to developing on Mac OS X.  I found the instruction to be be very good.  I would recommend this course for anyone that has some programming background but finds the classroom setting a little easier to work with.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.cocoadevcentral.com/">Cocoa Dev Central:</a></b> I wish I would have known about this before I started down the path of the Peepcode screencast.  Yet since I purchased the Peepcode screencast, a reference was made to this site.  I guess I wouldn't have known about it had I not gotten the screencast.  Sounds like a paradox to me.  Anyway, the site was great and you could find anything you needed to if you're learning about the intricacies of Objective-C and Cocoa.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>After thoroughly going through all of the material I've mentioned above, I actually did decide to write an iPhone app.  I decided against releasing it to the App Store because, well, I think it wasn't the best quality.  Anyway, I don't claim to be a master at Objective-C, but I know enough to be dangerous.  I believe that going through the above references will make you just as dangerous!</p>

<p>If you're an absolute <strong>beginner</strong>, I would recommend starting with the Stanford class first, and then going over to the Cocoa Dev Central site and skipping the Peepcode screencast all together.  Now if that's still too much for you, well you need to start all the way at the beginning by <a href="http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/">learning C</a>.  At least you haven't burned any money on education.</p>

<p><h3>If you do decide to write an app for the iPhone here are some posts that I found useful:</h3>
