Well I got my first ski of the season in. The gf and I made it out to Vail around the beginning of this month, more precisely we were there from 12/6 through 12/10. It happened to be just the two of us and we had a great time. Unfortunately the conditions on the mountain weren't as favorable as we would have liked them to be and I managed to crack one of my skis....

The entire time that we were there it didn't snow at all. That kinda sucked especially since the last snow Vail had was 7 days before we showed up at the resort.

Here are a couple of things that I learned on this trip:
<ul><li>Never try to fly in on the early morning flight and try to get to the slopes on the same day, it will only lead to heartbreak. </li><li>Always get a 4x4 when driving around the mountains in CO</li><li>EZ Car Rental kicks ass</li><li>East Vail is too far from the resort</li><li>West Vail is where its at.</li><li>The back bowls on a warm day in Vail are not a lot of fun</li><li>Skiing + Extended Warm Weather = Exposed Rocks = Bad News</li></ul><p>I definately recommend going to Vail, but doing so at the beginning of Dec is a real gamble. Some of the folks we talked to at the resort had told us that in years prior they didn't get any snow. </p><p>Pics from the trip coming soon</p>
