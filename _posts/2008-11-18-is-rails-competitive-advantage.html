My short answer.... Not anymore.

A competitive advantage can be defined as an advantage a firm has over its competitors. Yet two types of competitive advantages exist, cost advantage and differentiation advantage.  Rails currently provides a cost advantage but it’s starting to erode.  As for a differentiation advantage, I have a hard time justifying Rails as one in and of itself anymore.

In this part one of a two part series, I’ll explore the cost advantages Rails has in the marketplace.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Advantage</span>

It's defined as the ability of a firm to deliver the same benefits as competitors at a lower cost. I don't want to spend too much time in this area, because countless others (<a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/L.cfm?doc=1105-1/2008">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/industry-news/php-vs-java-vs-ruby-000887.php">2</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/58026">3</a>, <a href="http://www.csc.com/aboutus/leadingedgeforum/knowledgelibrary/uploads/1131_1.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://rewrite.rickbradley.com/pages/moving_to_rails.html">5</a>) have talked about how using Rails to develop web applications has saved, time, money and energy while increasing the speed to market.  What I do want to talk about is competing on cost and how that will be difficult to do so with Rails in the near future.

Most of the stories that we've heard have been related to how Rails has saved teams so much money in development time.  Yet these stories have pitted Rails against Java, .NET, or (insert other framework here).  When Rails goes up against these other frameworks it has a distinct cost advantage.  But what happens when the Rails is pitted against Rails?  Here’s the problem:
<ul><li>Rails community is getting bigger</li><li>More businesses have been looking to use Ruby for their projects</li><li>Rails is open-source
</li></ul>I’m not saying that because Rails is open-source that’s a bad thing.  What I am saying is that the barriers to entry for developers and businesses looking to get into developing with Rails are zero because it’s open-source and freely available for use.  Also, that means that more and more people are looking for work.  On top of that, because the ecosystem around Rails is very community driven, once a developer sets a best practice with Rails that results in some kind of efficiency, everyone else in the community will copy that almost immediately.  That will therefore reduce any cost benefit attained by the original developers. 

Once everyone starts competing on cost in the Rails community, everyone starts fighting for business based upon their price for getting the application up and running.  Customers will then start to make their choices based upon price and the lowest price will always win.

The moral of the story is that if you’re gunning for a project where the technology has not been decided upon like should we use Java vs. Rails, Rails can provide a cost advantage.  Yet if the customer is already set on using Rails, you’d better come up with another strategy for getting that business other than using cost.  That’s something I’ll explore in my next post.

For more detail on using cost to compete, read the section on 'Operational Effectiveness' from Michael Porter’s article in Harvard Business, <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2165.html">Strategy and the Internet</a>.
