Unlike most other programming languages, SAS does not have its own framework for Testing.  This can be somewhat frustrating when developing processes to convert data or to evaluate large datasets.

Well that time is over.  I found the <a href="http://www.thotwave.com/products/futs.jsp">FUTS</a> framework on the web.  It was incredibly easy to find, I just typed "testing" and "SAS" into google and viola!   This framework was only released in March so its only been on the block for a little while.  It's such a great development because now like JUnit and NUnit, I can preform unit tests alot easier against my code.

This framework only works on unix/linux and windows system.  That kinda stinks since most of the work that I do is done on a z/OS box.  I'm going to attempt to port this to our mainframes at work, because I think it will be able to increase the quality of all of the work that we do.

I'll keep everyone updated on the results.
