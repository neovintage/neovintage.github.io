I recently purchased a new car.   Ahh...  cars.  Something like like to deem a necessary evil.  Really, if you dont live in a major metro area, you definately need to have that car.  Theres just no other way to get around town.  Unfortunate at best, but oh well. 

You must be thinking, well what kind of car did you get?  If cars are such a necessary evil, you must have purchased something thats modest.  So... I ended up purchasing a Nissan Xterra.  I know, I know, if cars are such an evil, why did I get something that really isn't so modest.  I figured I really wanted something with utility and that wasn't so cushy.  I really trashed my last car, and I didn't want anything that wouldn't be able to handle a little beating up. 

Anyway, I'm pleased with my purchase, although the gas prices piss me off sometimes, but I guess thats what I get for buying an suv.  Maybe I'll get some pics up here of the new wheels.
