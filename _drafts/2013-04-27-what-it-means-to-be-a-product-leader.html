<p>For the last few months, I've moved into more of a product leader role at CarWoo! and man, it's been quite a ride.  I've learned so much in the short time span of seven months.  </p><br />
<p>This is what I've learned:<br />
1. There are going to be people that push their priorities at all costs.<br />
2. You really need to have some semblance of a tech background if you're a product manager<br />
3. Understand who is your target market and understand where you are the product adoption phase<br />
4. You can't please everyone<br />
5. Say NO!<br />
